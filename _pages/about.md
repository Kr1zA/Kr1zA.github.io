### Title:

Interactive Exponates in Science Centers

### Description:

In this Thesis we describe new way to calibrate the camera (Kinect) and projector system. We have designed our own way of gaining point pairs using the character skeleton obtained directly from Kinect. Our solution is fast, simple, does not require a lot of point pairs. We designed, implemented and practically verifed the ninja keyboard exhibit and ping-pong game.

### Goals:

1. Analyze interactive exhibits exploiting virtual or augmented reality
2. Implement interactive exhibits exploiting virtual or augmented reality
